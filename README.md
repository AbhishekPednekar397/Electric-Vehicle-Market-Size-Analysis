# Electric-Vehicle-Market-Size-Analysis

## Context and Content :

**Market Size Analysis is the process of estimating the potential sales for a product or service within a particular market segment. In the context of electric vehicles (EV's), it involves assessing the total volume of EV registrations to understand the growth of the market, forecast future trends, and help stakeholders make informed decisions regarding production, infrastructure development, and policy-making.** 


## Primary objective :

**The primary objective of this analysis is to leverage historical EV registration data to understand the current market penetration of EVs, predict future market growth, and identify key trends and factors driving market expansion. The specific goals include:**

 - **Assess the historical growth trend of EV registrations.** 

- **Forecast future EV registrations based on historical trends.** 

- **Analyze the distribution of EV registrations across different models, makes, and geographical regions.** 

- **Estimate the market size and growth potential of the EV market for upcoming years.** 

- **Provide insights to support stakeholders in decision-making processes related to production, infrastructure planning, and policy formulation.** 

## Key Learnings from the Electric Vehicle Market Size Analysis Project :

**Data Analysis with Python:** 

Gained proficiency in using Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy) for analyzing large datasets. Learned how to handle Null values, data cleaning techniques and write complex codes to retrieve specific data points and perform aggregations using groupby and statistical functions.

**EV Adoption Over Time:** 

Analyzed the growth in the Number of Electric Vehicles Registration over more than 2 decades. From the analysis, I found that EV adoption has been increasing over time especially it has seen an upward trend since 2016.

**Geographical Distribution:** 

Learned to evaluate popularity of EV adoption by different geographical areas. Analyzed and understood, exactly in which County and City where the EVs most commonly registered.

**Consumer Preference over EV Types:** 

Analyzed consumer purchasing behaviour, towards the EV types such as Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV). Used insights to understand consumer preferences and the adoption patterns of purely electric vs. hybrid electric solutions.

**EV Make and Model Popularity with Electric Range:** 

Identified the most popular makes and models among the registered EVs. Also analyzed the Electric Range (miles), these EV models can cover in a single charge. These analysis provided actionable insights which can help consumer decide, which Electric Vehicle is more suitable for him, according to his requirements. 

**Estimated Growth in Market Size:** 

Analyzed and found the estimated growth in the market size of electric vehicles. Calculated the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) between a recent year with complete data (2023) and an earlier year to project the 2024 figures. Additionally, using this growth rate, also estimated the market size for the next five years upto 2029.

**Effective Data Presentation:** 

Learned how to present data findings in clear and concise manner. Used Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries in Python for data visualizations and appropriate graphs to effectively communicate insights.

This project not only enhanced technical skills in Python but also provided practical experience in data analysis and interpretation, which are critical for making informed business decisions.
